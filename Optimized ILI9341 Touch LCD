# Optimized ILI9341 LCD with touch

This is a simple library who is optimized for touch and screen. What I have done is that I had made a project that don't use threads and therefore I have optimized this
LCD library so it can write out images very fast using only two SPI. One SPI for the touch and one SPI for the LCD.
