# STM32-Libraries
Collection of rewritten Arduino C++ libraries to STM32 C libraies. 

## Liquid Crystal LCD Display with I2C Expander IC
Rewritten Arduino C++ library from ![johnrickman](https://github.com/johnrickman/LiquidCrystal_I2C) to STM32 C library. Added some more features as well. Works for both 16x2 LCD and 20x4 LCD etc.

## MAX31865 RTD Temperature sensor reader
Rewritten STM32 C library from ![4ilo](https://github.com/4ilo/MAX31865-Stm32HAL) so it will fit multiple PT100 sensors at multiple  MAX31865 IC:s. Also I have increase the speed of the library as well.
