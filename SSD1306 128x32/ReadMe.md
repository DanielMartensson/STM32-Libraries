# SSD1306 128x32
This is a simple OLED LCD that have two colors only. Use this LCD if you want to show something simple like a number or display
a tiny plot. Notice that this LCD can only have one address. So only one SSD1306 128x32 per project. Connection I2C.

Program example:

```

  // include
  #include "main.h"
  #include "SSD1306 128x32/SSD1306.h"
  
  // Struct
  I2C_HandleTypeDef hi2c1;
  
  // Code
  SSD1306_init(&hi2c1);
  SSD1306_draw_line(0, 15, 0, 3);
  SSD1306_dim(true);
  SSD1306_write_text("Megaman!1", 15, 15);
